Fear of monsters
Fear of dogs
Fear of hurricanes or bogs
Fear of anger
Fear of fear
Fear of losing someone dear
Fear of spiders
Fear of feet
Fear of strangers in the street
Fear of falling
Fear of drowning
Fear of wrinkles caused by frowning
Fear of dragons
Fear of night
Fear of all the things that might
Or might not pass
Fear of being last in class

But fear's ok
Yes, fear's alright
For now I have it in my sight
And when I'm overwhelmed by fright
I recognise its painful bite
(And that is more than half the fight)

So yes I'm fearful, yet I'm brave
And when my fear will not behave
I gently pat fear on the head
And send fear off to go to bed
